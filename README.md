# This is an implementation of PCA and Dual PCA
## Part 1. Implement PCA and Dual PCA algorithm from scratch
eig_val and eig_vec are eigenvalues and eigenvectors respectively
## Part 2. Visualisation the projection results
plot 3 2-D projection results
## Part 3. Use PCA and Dual PCA for image compresssion
This is part also shows how to display the k eigenface images(k is the optimal number for eigenvectors)
## Part 4. Application: face recognition
Estalish SVM face recognition system with PCA
